        • Formats your log messages with extra useful
          information such as timestamp, severity,

        • Filters are for more fine-tuned filtering that can
          be provided with log levels.
        • Can also be used for more sophisticated things
          like counting logs, injecting contextual information
          into a log record or even modifying the severity.
