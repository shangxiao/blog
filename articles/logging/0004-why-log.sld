    • We want to conduct record keeping to provide
      useful information to aide in the analysis of problems
      after-the-fact.

    • Pinpoint errors via exceptions
    • Understanding of the flow of the application
      while in the hands of customers (and interactive with 3rd
      party vendors)
    • Can't reproduce errors
